## Data

The data are provided by Statistics Sweden.

Getting access to the data was an arguably complicated process in the
past. I have been granted access to the data three times over the past
decade. The first and second time that I got access to the SCB data was
by writing a policy report for the Expertgruppen för Studier i Offentlig
ekonomi (ESO, Expert Group on Public Economics). For this, we wrote a
research proposal, which was subsequently granted. Noted that I also
wrote another unsuccessful proposal a few years later.

The third time that I got access to the SCB data was by writing a policy
report for the Committee on Equality. As part of the policy report, I
conducted an empirical analysis that required access to this data.

In all cases, I was allowed to use this data to write research papers
that are related and within the scope of the respective policy report.

Detailed description of the data can be found in:

Public Economics, Ministry of Finance, Stockholm, June 8, 2012.

## Code

There are two files. The first file creates the dataset from the raw
data. The second file runs all regressions.

-   Once you have the necessary raw data, please edit the project path
    in ‘Data generation Jacob 2021 JCF.do’ (line 11) and ‘Tables &
    Figures Jacobs 2021 JCF.do’ (line 6), with your own project folder.
